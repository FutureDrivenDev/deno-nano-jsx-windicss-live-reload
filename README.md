# Nano JSX with Deno

### Getting started

- Install [denon](https://github.com/denosaurs/denon)
- Run: `denon start`
- Open: [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/)
- Change files - denon restarts server.

### Next step:

I want to make the browser automatically reload when it detects the server has restarted. I will use SSR and a timestamp.
